About:
Our project is an AI Chess Game Project using Python. We are utilizing Python and Pygame (which is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games). Our project features a graphical user interface (UI) that allows users to move the chess pieces on the board, with each piece type having their own movement functionality. The current state of the board is converted into a matrix, and then used as input into the Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, this will allow the AI to select an optimal move. Afterwards the user can make their chess move and then click a UI button so that the algorithm runs the algorithm to calculate the next move, hence, playing chess with an AI algorithm.

How to run our project:
1. Download Python
2. Download Pycharm or IntelliJ
3. Add the package for Pygames
4. Open the project in either IDE and open the main.py file and select run in the program starting in the main.py file.
5. Upon running the program, you should see a Chess board, you can run the AI using “Start”, clear the board with “Reset” after moving pieces around the board, or LEFT mouse click to select a piece, or RIGHT mouse click to unselect the piece.
6. You can now play chess with the AI.
